Based on [Tim Bergholz's Shortcuts](https://www.artstation.com/timbergholz) for Autodesk 3ds Max.

I really wanted a printable reference to make it easier to follow along with Tim's excellent courses.

Disclaimer: Some of the shortcuts that are supposed to bring up settings dialogs don't work in Max 2019 for me.
